MniakLibs; A collection of libraries to make your life easier
======================================================

This project is a work in progress.
It is a collection of libraries that grew up naturally in response to my daily needs.


Projects
------------------
For now, the project contains two libraries:
1. Mniak.IO
2. Mniak.Network

### Mniak.IO
This library includes
- An Hybrid Stream to avoid `OutOfMemoryException` when dealing large files, but to still use **Memory** when dealing with small ones;

### Mniak.Network
- Event-based socket reading

[View the documentation of this library](docs/Mniak.Network.md)
